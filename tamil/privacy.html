                        <p>
                                First things first – your privacy is important to us. We know that’s what all these
                                kinds of notices say, but we really mean
                                it. You’ve placed your trust in us by using YoYo services, and we value that trust. That
                                means we’re committed to protecting and safeguarding any personal data you give us. We
                                act
                                in our customers' interest and are transparent about the processing of your personal
                                data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                This document describes how we use and process your personal data, hopefully provided in
                                a readable and transparent manner
                                so you can understand where we’re coming from without dying of boredom. As an added
                                bonus,
                                it also tells you how to contact us if you have questions about your personal data,
                                which
                                we’re more than happy to answer. You should also check out our separate Cookie
                                Statement,
                                which tells you how YoYo makes use of cookies and other similar technologies. For a
                                better
                                understanding of what we mean by “Video call,” “Video messages,” “other Services,” and

                        <p>
                                If you’ve ever used our services before, you know that YoYo offers online
                                entertainment-related services through our own
                                mobile apps. It's good to know that all the information that follows applies to not one,
                                not two, but all of these platforms. We have several platforms, but one Privacy
                                Statement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                This one Privacy Statement applies to any kind of information we collect through these
                                platforms or other means connected
                                to these platforms (like reaching out to our Customer Service team, for example). It
                                makes
                                reading all of this a lot simpler. If you're one of our business partners (Content
                                Provider),
                                please check out our Privacy Statement for Business Partners(Celebrities) as well, to
                                understand
                                how personal data is further processed as part of the business relationship.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                We might amend the Privacy Statement from time to time. If you care about your privacy,
                                visit this page regularly to know
                                exactly where you stand. If we make changes to the Privacy Statement which will have an
                                impact
                                on you (e.g. if we intend to process your personal data for other purposes than
                                communicated
                                in the past in this Privacy Statement), we'll notify you of these changes before the new
                                activities begin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The hard truth: If you disagree with this Privacy Statement, you should discontinue
                                using our services. If you agree with
                                our Privacy Statement, then you’re all set to schedule your next service.

                                                information about you from other sources. These include
                                                business partners, like affiliate partners, subsidiaries of the YoYo

                                                provided by you. For example, the YoYo services are not only made
                                                available
                                                by YoYo and the YoYo apps, but are also integrated into services of

                                                partners you can find online. When you use some of these, you provide

                                                service scheduling details to our business partner, who then forwards

                                                details to us. We also integrate third-party service providers to

                                                payment between schedulers and content Providers. These service

                                        Another example is how we integrate communication services into our platforms to

                                        Provider about your call. When we do, we receive metadata about communication
                                        activities
                                        (e.g. where you called, who you are, the date and length of the call, etc.). We
                                        might
                                        also receive information about you to deliver you more relevant advertisements,

                                        shared with YoYo by that social media provider, but only when you don't mind

                                        doing so. You always have the choice to not share this data.

                                        Content Providers might share information about you with YoYo too – this might
                                        happen if you have support questions about
                                        your pending scheduled call when disputes arise about a video call.

                                                When you make calls to our Customer Service Team, YoYo uses an automated

                                                telephone number to your existing reservations – this can help save
                                                time for both you and our customer support staff. Our customer service

                                                details are kept confidential. During calls with our customer service
                                                team, live listening might be conducted, or calls might be recorded
                                                for quality control and training purposes, which includes the usage

                                                amount of time, then automatically deleted later on, unless YoYo
                                                has a legitimate interest to keep these recording for a longer period,

                                                Here at YoYo, we use social media in different ways. We use it partly to
                                                facilitate the use of app based service scheduling,
                                                but also to promote our content Providers’ related products and
                                                services,
                                                as well as to advertise, improve, and facilitate our own services.

                                                Login with your social media account. We offer you the opportunity to
                                                sign into a YoYo user account with your social media
                                                account, which saves you from having to remember different user names
                                                and
                                                passwords for different online services. After you’ve signed in once,
                                                you’ll
                                                always be able to use your social media account to sign in to your YoYo
                                                account.
                                                You can decouple these accounts from each other anytime.
