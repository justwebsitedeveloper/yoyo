Each content Provider acts in a professional manner vis-à-vis YoYo when making its product and/or service available on or through YoYo (both for its business-to-business ("B2B") and/or business-to-consumer ("B2C") relationship). Note that content Providers may have, declare applicable, and/or require (acceptance of) – in addition to the policies and fine print as disclosed on the website, their own (usage) terms and conditions and house rules for the use, access, and consummation of the service (which may include certain disclaimers and limitations of liability). </p>

        <h2><li>Scope & Nature of Our Service</li></h2>
        <p>Through the Platform, we (Bhishma and its affiliates or partners) provide a mobile app platform through which content Providers—in their professional conduct of business (i.e. B2C or B2B)—can advertise, market, sell, promote, and/or offer (as applicable) their products and services for scheduling, purchase, reservation, and through which relevant visitors of the Platform can discover, search, compare, and schedule, reserve, purchase, or payment (i.e. the scheduled Service). By using or utilizing the Services (e.g. by making a Service scheduling through the App Services list), you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the content Provider with which you make a schedule or purchase a product or service (as applicable). From the point at which you make your Service scheduling, we act solely as an intermediary between you and the content Provider, transmitting the relevant details of your Service scheduling to the relevant content Provider(s) and sending you a confirmation email for and on behalf of the content Provider.  </p>
        <p>When rendering our Service, the information that we disclose is based on the information provided by you. As such, we, on behalf of the content Providers market and promote their service on the Platform and are fully responsible for updating all rates/fees/prices, availability, policies and conditions, and other relevant information which is displayed on our Platform. Although we will use reasonable skill and care in performing our Service, we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that all information is accurate, complete, or correct, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including call schedules , content providers availability and typographical errors), any interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade, or maintenance of our Platform or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading, or untrue information or non-delivery of information. Each content Provider remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness, and correctness of the (descriptive) information (including the rates/fees/prices, policies and conditions, and availability) displayed on our Platform. Our Platform does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of the quality, service level, qualification, or (star) rating of any content Provider (products or services) made available.</p>
        <p>Our Service is made available for personal and commercial use only. Therefore, you are not allowed to resell, deep link, use, copy, monitor (e.g. spider, scrape), display, download, or reproduce any content or information, software, reservations, products, or services available on our Platform for any commercial or competitive activity or purpose. </p>
        
        <h2><li>Prices, Crossed-Out Rates </li></h2>
        <p>The prices as offered on behest of the content Providers on our Platform are highly individualised. All prices for your service are displayed including GST/sales tax and all other taxes (subject to change of such taxes) and fees, unless stated differently on our Platform or the confirmation email. Service prices are per person or group and subject to validity or expiration as indicated on the schedule, if applicable. Applicable fees and taxes (including any applicable tax) may be charged by the content Provider in the event of a no-show or cancellation. </p>
        <p>Sometimes lower rates are available on our Platform for a specific service or, product, however, these rates made available by us may carry special restrictions and conditions, for example non-cancelable and non-refundable. Check the relevant product, service, and specific conditions and details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to availing your respective service.</p>
        <p>The currency converter is for information purposes only and should not be relied upon as accurate and real time; actual rates may vary. </p>
        <p>Obvious errors and mistakes (including misprints) are not binding. </p>
        <p>All special offers and promotions are marked as such. If they are not labeled as such, you cannot derive any rights in the event of obvious errors or mistakes. </p>
        
        <h2><li>Privacy and Cookies </li></h2>
        <p>YoYo respects your privacy. Please take a look at our Privacy and Cookies Policy for further information. </p>

        <h2><li>Pay for the services you avail only! </li></h2>
        <p>Unless indicated otherwise, You will pay for the services provided by the content Provider the relevant amount as indicated (plus—insofar not included in the price—relevant applicable taxes, levies, and fees (if applicable)). </p>
        <p>Content Providers work on a payment terms as agreed with Bhishma in a separate agreement after the end user has consummated the service or product of the content Provider (e.g. after the successful completion of the service requested and delivered/consumed). Content Providers can improve their ranking by increasing their time spent in the Yoyo app. </p>
        <p>Only content Providers which have a commercial relationship with YoYo (through an agreement) will be made available on Platform (for their B2B and/or B2C promotion of their product). YoYo is not an open platform where end users can make their product available (no C2C platform); YoYo does not allow non-professional parties to offer or sell their products on or through YoYo. </p>

        <h2><li>Credit Card or Bank Transfer </li></h2>
        <p>If applicable and available, certain service Providers (credit card) offer the opportunity for payments to be paid (wholly or partly and as required under the payment policy of the service Provider) to the content Provider during the service scheduling process, by means of secure online payment (all to the extent offered and supported by your bank). For certain products and services, YoYo facilitates (through third party payment processors) the payment of the relevant product or service (i.e. the payment facilitation service) for and on behalf of the content Provider (YoYo never acts nor operates as the merchant of record). Payment is safely processed from your credit/debit card or bank account to the bank account of the accommodation provider through a third party payment processor. Any payment facilitated by us for and on behalf of, and transferred to the content Provider will in each case constitute a payment of (part of) the scheduled price paid by you of the relevant product or service in final settlement of such (partial) due and payable price and you cannot reclaim such paid monies. </p>
        <p>For certain (non-refundable) rates or special offers, note that service Providers may require that payment be made upfront by wire transfer (if available) or by credit card, and therefore your credit card may be pre-authorized or charged (sometimes without any option for refund) upon making the service Reservation. Check the (Service scheduling) details of your product or service of choice thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your Service scheduling. You will not hold YoYo liable or responsible for any (authorized, (allegedly) unauthorized or wrong) charge by the content Provider and not (re)claim any amount for any valid or authorized charge by the content Provider (including for pre-paid rates, no-show, and chargeable cancellation) of your credit/debit card. </p>
        <p>In the event of credit card fraud or unauthorized use of your credit card by third parties, most banks and credit card companies bear the risk and cover all the charges resulting from such fraud or misuse, which may sometimes be subject to a deductible (usually set as per your local law). In the event that your credit card company or bank charges the deductible from you because of unauthorized transactions resulting from a reservation made on our Platform, we will pay you this deductible amount, if the report of such unauthorised use is made within 24 hours. In order to indemnify you, make sure that you report this fraud to your credit card provider (in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures) and contact us immediately by email (unauthorized.use@YoYostarz.com). State "credit card fraud" in the subject line of your email and provide us with evidence of the charged deductible (e.g. policy of the credit card company). This indemnification only applies to credit card usage made using YoYo's secure server and the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through our default or negligence and through no fault of your own while using the secure server. </p>

        <h2><li>Prepayment, Cancellation, No-shows, and The Fine Print </li></h2>
        <p>By scheduling a service with a content Provider, you accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of that content Provider, and to any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the content Provider that may apply to your Service (including the fine print of the content Provider made available on our Platform and the relevant house rules of the content Provider), including for services rendered and/or products offered by the content Provider. The relevant (delivery/purchase/use/carrier) terms and conditions of a Content Provider can be obtained with the relevant content Provider. The general cancellation and no-show policy of each content Provider is made available on our Platform on the content Provider information pages, during the scheduling procedure and in the confirmation email or in-app notifications (if applicable). Note that certain rates, fees, or special offers are not eligible for cancellation, refund, or change. Applicable taxes may still be charged by the Content Provider in the event of a no-show or charged cancellation. Check the (schedule) details of your product or service of choice thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. Note that a Service scheduling which requires down payment or (wholly or partly) prepayment may be canceled (without a prior notice of default or warning) insofar the relevant (remaining) amount(s) cannot be collected in full on the relevant due or payment date in accordance with the relevant payment policy of the Content Provider and the scheduled service. Cancellation and prepayment policies may vary per segment, product, or service of each Service. Carefully read The Fine Print (below the Service types or at the bottom of each Content Provider page on our Platform) and important information in your scheduled service confirmation for additional policies as may be applied by the content Provider. Late payment, wrong bank, debit or credit card details, invalid credit/debit cards or insufficient funds are for your own risk and account, and you will not be entitled to any refund of any (non-refundable) prepaid amount unless the Content Provider agrees or allows otherwise under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy. </p>
        <p>If you want to review, adjust, or cancel your Service scheduling, revert to the confirmation email and follow the instructions therein. Note that you may be charged for your cancellation in accordance with the content Provider's cancellation, re-scheduling and no-show policy, or not be entitled to any repayment of any (pre)paid amount. We recommend that you read the cancellation, (pre)payment and no-show policy of the accommodation provider carefully prior to scheduling your service, and remember to make further payments on time as may be required for the relevant scheduled service. </p>
        <p>YoYo does not accept any liability or responsibility for the consequences of your delayed arrival to the scheduled  call or any cancellation or charged no-show fee by the content Provider. </p>

        <h2><li>(Further) Correspondence and Communication  </li></h2>
        <p>By completing a Service scheduling, you agree to receive (i) an email which we may send you shortly prior to the scheduled service date, giving you information on your service schedule and providing you with certain information and offers (including third-party offers to the extent that you have actively opted in for this information) relevant to your scheduled Service and call, (ii) an email after the scheduled appointment to rate the (experience with your) content Provider and the opted Service, and (iii) an email which we may send to you promptly after your interaction with the content provider inviting you to complete our guest review form. See our privacy and cookies policy for more information about how we may contact you. </p>
        <p>YoYo disclaims any liability or responsibility for any communication by or with the content Provider on or through any other means other than its platform. You cannot derive any rights from any request to, or communication with the content Provider or (any form of) acknowledgement of receipt of any communication or request. YoYo cannot guarantee that any request or communication will be (duly and timely) received/read by, complied with, executed, or accepted by the content Provider. </p>
        <p>In order to duly complete and secure your scheduled Service, you need to use your correct email address/mobile number. We are not responsible or liable for (and have no obligation to verify) any wrong or misspelled email address, or inaccurate or wrong (mobile) phone number or credit card number. </p>
        <p>Any claim or complaint against YoYo or in respect to the Service must be promptly submitted, but in any event within 24 hours after the scheduled day of consummation of the product or service (e.g. scheduled appointment date). Any claim or complaint that is submitted after the 24 hours period may be rejected, and the claimant will forfeit the right to any (damage or cost) compensation. </p>
        <p>Due to the continuous update and adjustments of rates and availability, we strongly suggest to make screenshots when scheduling a service to support your position (if needed). </p>

        <h2><li>Ranking, Preferred Program, Stars and User Reviews </li></h2>
        <p>The default setting of the ranking of content providers on our Platform is "YoYo Recommends" (or any similar wording); this is the Default Ranking. Note that the Default Ranking is created through a complex ever-changing and evolving system (algorithm) that considers a multitude of criteria in order to match searchers and appointments in an optimal way. The actual ranking will be different for each user and for each search as there are many criteria included, for example the popularity of a service appointment among our users, customer service history (including the number and type of user complaints), certain appointment-related data (e.g. number of appointments, cancellations, conversion rate, availability, etc.) and the (past) browsing activities of a user. Note that for convenience we also offer other ways to rank content providers. An user can choose to rank, for example, service appointments on the basis of lowest price first, review scores, schedule type (etc.). An user thus has full control on the presentation of the search results. </p>
        <p>In certain categories and regions, YoYo operates a preferred partnership program(e.g. Revenue sharing model), allowing certain content Providers that meet and maintain the preferred program terms to be listed ahead of the rest of the content Providers in the default “Recommended” ranking for the relevant category/region. The preferred content Providers are marked with a “thumbs-up” symbol and in return for this high ranking, the preferred content Provider gets paid a higher percentage. Only content Providers that meet and maintain certain qualification criteria can be listed as preferred. </p>
        <p>Only users who have scheduled a service appointment will be invited by YoYo to comment on their interaction on the relevant services and to provide a score for certain aspects of their service. The completed user review (including submitted rating during your service utilised) may be (a) uploaded onto the relevant content Provider's information page on our Platform for the sole purpose of informing (future) users of their opinion of the service (level) and quality of the content Provider, and (b) (wholly or partly) used and placed by YoYo at its sole discretion (e.g. for marketing, promotion, or improvement of our service) on our Platform or such social media platforms, newsletters, special promotions, apps, or other channels owned, hosted, used, or controlled by YoYo and our business partners. In order to offer and maintain recent (and therefore relevant) reviews, reviews can only be submitted within a limited period of time (7 days) after the completion of a service appointment and each review will only be available for a limited period of time (12 months) after posting. The default ranking of the reviews is by date of submission relative to a few additional criteria (such as language, reviews with comments), whereas a review of a user who [always] submits comprehensive and detailed reviews may be ranked on top. You have the option to choose various different forms of ranking and filter (e.g. by audience, date, language, score). YoYo does allow the content Provider to respond to a review. We reserve the right to adjust, refuse, or remove reviews at our sole discretion insofar it violates our review policy. YoYo does not compensate or otherwise reward a user for completing a review. The user review form should be regarded as a survey and does not include any (further commercial) offers, invitations, or incentives whatsoever. YoYo undertakes to use its best efforts to monitor and remove reviews that include obscenities or the mention of an individual’s name and it reserves all rights to legally pursue against you on any such violations under the Indian Laws.  </p>
        <p>
                YoYo will not accept reviews which include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Profanity, sexually explicit, hate speech, discriminatory, threats, violence </li>
            <li>Mention of full names, personal attack towards the staff/content providers </li>
            <li>Promoting illegal activities through a service appointment (e.g. drugs, prostitution)</li>
            <li>Sites, emails, and addresses, phone numbers, cc details </li>
            <li>Politically sensitive comments </li>
        </ul>
        <p>YoYo and the content Provider are each entitled to terminate their relationship for whatever reason (including in the event of breach of contract or (filing for) bankruptcy) with due observance of the relevant notice period as agreed between both parties </p>

        <h2><li>Disclaimer </li></h2>
